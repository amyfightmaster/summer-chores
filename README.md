# Callback Assignment: Summer Chores
This project demonstrates the use of Javascript callbacks by simulating a list of summer chores, where the previous chores must be successfully completed for the next one to be performed. This assignment is from Week 2 of Module 3 in the Code:You program (Jan. 2025 cohort).

## How To Run
Please make sure you have node.js installed.
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/amyfightmaster/summer-chores.git 
Navigate to the folder: cd summer-chores. Run the program: node callbackVersion.js.

### What I Learned
This project was an excellent opportunity to further practice the use of asynchronous code and callbacks in Javascript! 
Additionally, it was really great practice with using setTimeout. 
And also Math.random to increase the "tiredness level" of the person doing the chores (that is, the likelihood that the person will fall asleep with each chore).

#### Please Note:
Sometimes, the chore fails due to the use of randomness. 
The "tiredness level" does go up with each completed chore, but there is a chance that all chores can be successfully completed.

# Summer Chores Using Promises
Note: This assignment is slightly later in Week 2 of Module 3.  This project demonstrates the use of promises in Javascript, including how to construct promises and chain them using .then() and .catch().  

## How to Run
Please make sure you have node.js installed.
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/amyfightmaster/summer-chores.git 
Navigate to the folder: cd summer-chores. Run the program: node promiseVersion.js.

### What I Learned
This project was difficult, but it was a great opportunity to go hands-on with promises and deepen my understanding asynchronous code!  Additionally, I've noticed that using promises seems (to me) to be easier to read than using multiple callbacks.    

#### Please Note:
Sometimes, the chore fails due to the use of randomness. 
The "tiredness level" does go up with each completed chore, but there is a chance that all chores can be successfully completed.
